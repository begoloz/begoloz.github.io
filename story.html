			THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best
			could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.
			You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not
			suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length
			I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled—
			but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,
			precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish
			with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution
			overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the
			avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has
			done the wrong. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had
			I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued,
			as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive
			that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation. 
		</p>
		<p>
			He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in
			other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.
			He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few
			Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their
			enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity—to
			practise imposture upon the British and Austrian
			millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his
			countrymen, was a quack—but in the matter of old wines he
			was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him
			materially: I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and
			bought largely whenever I could.

			It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme
			madness of the <span class="word" id="carnival" >carnival</span> season, that I encountered my friend.
			He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been
			drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tightfitting
			parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical
			cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I
			thought I should never have done wringing his hand. 
		</p>
	</div>


	<div class="pages" id="page2">
		
		<p>
			I said to him: “My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.
			How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have
			received a pipe of what passes for <span class="word" id="amontillado">Amontillado</span>, and I have
			my doubts.” 
		</p>
		<p>
			“How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible!<br>
			And in the middle of the carnival!”<br>
			“I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough
			to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in
			the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of
			losing a bargain.”<br>
			“Amontillado!”<br>
			“I have my doubts.”<br>
			“Amontillado!”<br>
			“And I must satisfy them.”<br>
			“Amontillado!”<br>
			“As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If
			any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me——”<br>
			“Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”<br>
			“And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match
			for your own.”<br>
			“Come, let us go.”<br>
			“Whither?”<br>
			“To your vaults.”<br>
			“My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good
			nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi——”<br>
			“I have no engagement;—come.”<br>
			“My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe
			cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are
			insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.”<br>
			“Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing.
			Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for
			Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.”

		<p>
			Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm.
			Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a roquelaire
			closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my
			palazzo.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were no attendants at home; they had absconded
			to make merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I
			should not return until the morning, and had given them
			explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were
			sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate
			disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.
			I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving
			one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms
			to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long
			and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he
			followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and
			stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the
			Montresors.
		</p>
		<p>
			The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon
			his cap jingled as he strode.<br>
			“The pipe?” said he.<br>
			“It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white webwork
			which gleams from these cavern walls.”<br>
			He turned toward me, and looked into my eyes with two
			filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.
			“<span class="word" id="nitre">Nitre</span>?” he asked, at length.<br>
			“Nitre,” I replied. “How long have you had that
			cough?”<br>
			“Ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—
			ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!”<br>
			My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many
			minutes.<br>
			“It is nothing,” he said, at last.<br>
			“Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your
			health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; 
			you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed.
			For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I
			cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi——”
		</p>
	</div>


	<div class="pages" id="page4">

		<p>
			“Enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will
			not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.”<br>
			“True—true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention
			of alarming you unnecessarily; but you should use all proper
			caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the
			damps.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew
			from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.
			“Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.<br>
			He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and
			nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.<br>
			“I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”<br>
			“And I to your long life.”<br>
			He again took my arm, and we proceeded.<br>
			“These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”<br>
			“The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and
			numerous family.”<br>
			“I forget your arms.”<br>
			“A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot
			crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the
			heel.”<br>
			“And the motto?”<br>
			<span class="word" id="latin">“Nemo me impune lacessit.”</span><br>
			“Good!” he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My
			own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed
			through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons
			intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I
			paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by
			an arm above the elbow.
		</p>
		
	</div>
</section>
<section class="sec4">
	<div class="pages" id="page5">
		<p>
			“The nitre!” I said; “see, it increases. It hangs like moss
			upon the vaults. We are below the river’s bed. The drops of
			moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere
			it is too late. Your cough——”<br>
			“It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. But first, another
			draught of the Medoc.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He
			emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He
			laughed and threw the bottle upward with a gesticulation I
			did not understand.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the
			movement—a grotesque one.<br>
			“You do not comprehend?” he said.<br>
			“Not I,” I replied.<br>
			“Then you are not of the brotherhood.”<br>
			“How?”<br>
			“You are not of the <span class="word" id="masons">masons</span>.”<br>
			“Yes, yes,” I said; “yes, yes.”<br>
			“You? Impossible! A mason?”<br>
			“A mason,” I replied.<br>
			“A sign,” he said.<br>
			“It is this,” I answered, producing a trowel from beneath
			the folds of my roquelaire.<br>
			“You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “But
			let us proceed to the Amontillado.”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak,
			and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily.
			We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We
			passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on,
			and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the
			foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than
			flame.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="pages" id="page6">	
		<p>
			At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared
			another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human 
			remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the
			great <span class="word" id="catacombs">catacombs of Paris</span>. Three sides of this interior crypt
			were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the
			bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon
			the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within
			the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we
			perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in
			width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been
			constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed
			merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of
			the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their
			circumscribing walls of solid granite.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch,
			endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination
			the feeble light did not enable us to see.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado. As for
			Luchesi——”<br>
			“He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he
			stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at
			his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the
			niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood
			stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him
			to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant
			from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of
			these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.
			Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a
			few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to
			resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot
			help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is very damp. Once more let
			me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave
			you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my
			power.” 
		</p>
		
	</div>
</section>
<section class="sec5">
	<div class="pages" id="page7">	
		<p>
			“The Amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet
			recovered from his astonishment.<br>
			“True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”
		</p>
		<p>
			As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of
			bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I
			soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.
			With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began
			vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I
			discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great
			measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a
			low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the
			cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate
			silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth;
			and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The
			noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might
			hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors
			and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking
			subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without
			interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall
			was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused,
			and holding the <span class="word" id="torch">flambeaux</span> over the mason-work, threw a
			few feeble rays upon the figure within.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting
			suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to
			thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated—I
			trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it
			about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I
			placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and
			felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of
			him who clamored. I re-echoed—I aided—I surpassed them
			in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew
			still. 
		</p>
	</div>


	<div class="pages" id="page8">
		<p>
			It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a
			close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth
			tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh;
			there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered
			in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its
			destined position. But now there came from out the niche a
			low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was
			succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in
			recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said—
		</p>
		<p>
			“Ha! ha! ha!—he! he!—a very good joke indeed—an
			excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the
			palazzo—he! he! he!—over our wine—he! he! he!”<br>
			“The Amontillado!” I said.<br>
			“He! he! he!—he! he! he!—yes, the Amontillado. But is
			it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the
			palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.”<br>
			“Yes,” I said, “let us be gone.”<br>
			“For the love of God, Montresor!”<br>
			“Yes,” I said, “for the love of God!”<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I
			grew impatient. I called aloud:<br>
			“Fortunato!”<br>
			No answer. I called again:<br>
			“Fortunato!”<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining
			aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in reply only
			a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick—on account of
			the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of
			my labor. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered
			it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart
			of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed
			them. <span class="word" id="latin2">In pace requiescat!</span>

	<h1  >	Italian Carnival</h1>
		<p>The most famous Carnivals of Italy are held in Venice, Viareggio, and Ivrea.
			The Carnival in Venice was first recorded in 1268. Its subversive nature is reflected in 
			Italy's many laws over the centuries attempting to restrict celebrations and the wearing 
			of masks. Carnival celebrations in Venice were halted after the city fell under Austrian 
			control in 1798, but were revived in the late 20th century.

	<div class="fun_fact" id="page2_ff">
	<h1  >Amontillado</h1>
		<p>
			Amontillado is a variety of sherry wine characterized by being darker than fino but lighter than oloroso. It is named after the Montilla region of Spain, where the style originated in the 18th century, is characterized by nutty aromas, tobacco, aromatic herbs and often ethereal, polished notes of oak. The fusion of two different aging processes makes Amontillado wines extraordinarily complex and intriguing.
		</p>
	
	</div>

	<div class="fun_fact" id="page3_ff">
	<h1  >Nitre</h1>
		<p>
			Montresor and Fortunato refer to nitre several times. Montresor calls it "the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls." The nitre, therefore, represents the web, or the trap, Montresor has set for his victim.

	<div class="fun_fact" id="page4_ff">
	<h1  >Nemo me impune lacessit</h1>
		<p>
			Nemo me impune lacessit was the Latin motto of the Royal Stuart dynasty of Scotland from at least the reign of James VI when it appeared on the reverse side of merk coins minted in 1578 and 1580.
